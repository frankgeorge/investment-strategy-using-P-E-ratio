Since yahoo and google's api have been depreciated, I was trying other ways to download historical stock data. And I came across really cool libariers namely nsepy and backtrader from http://swapniljariwala.github.io. Tried to implement the same.

Backtesting involves market simulation in real world. It could be hard and error-prone to implement your trade stratergy in live market. Backtrader library helps in a big way to try out various market stratergies easily.
